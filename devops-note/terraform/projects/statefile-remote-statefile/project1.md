# Terraform Configuration Detailed Overview

## AWS EC2 Instance Setup
The EC2 instance setup allows us to deploy a virtual server in AWS. In this configuration:
- `t2.micro` is chosen for its low cost, suitable for development or small-scale applications.
- The subnet and AMI specifications tie the instance to a specific network and OS image.
- Tags help in identifying and managing the resource within AWS.

## AWS Provider Configuration
Specifying the AWS provider and region is crucial because:
- It informs Terraform which cloud provider to interact with.
- The region `ap-south-1` is set to localize resources in a specific geographic area, optimizing latency and compliance.

## AWS S3 Bucket
The S3 bucket serves as a storage solution for:
- Hosting static resources or any data.
- In this context, it's particularly used to store the Terraform state file, enabling shared state management.
- Tags like `Environment: Dev` indicate the bucket's usage context.

## AWS DynamoDB Table
A DynamoDB table is utilized here for:
- Storing the lock ID for Terraform state files to prevent concurrent state modifications, which is critical for team environments.
- The specified capacity units ensure that the table can handle the expected load.

## Terraform Backend Configuration
Configuring the backend using S3 and DynamoDB:
- Ensures that all Terraform state files are centrally stored and versioned in S3.
- Utilizes DynamoDB for state locking to secure the state against simultaneous edits, which is essential for maintaining state integrity across multiple users.
