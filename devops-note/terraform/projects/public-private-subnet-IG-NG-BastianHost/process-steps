// 1) create VPC
// 2) create private and public subnet within that VPC
// 3)now create 2 ec2 instance on those subnets i.e 1 in private and 1 in public .
//     public one act as bastian host or jumphost to private subnet and private 
//     ec2 are databases and enterprise confedential resources or data that should 
//     not be directly exposed to outer world
// 4) ingress and egress to VPC 
// 5) attach those security group to ec2 instances
// 6) create internet gateway in vpc and associate subnet to VPC also associate 
// that route table to public subnet
// 7) Now create NAT gateway
// 8) now for testing ssh into bastian host
// 9) now ssh into private ec2 
// 10) try to ping or update packages from private ec2 you should succeed because it
//     will use NAT gateway to access resource and remember it is unidirectional flow
//     we cannot access private ec2 from internt but we can access internet from 
//     private ec2.
