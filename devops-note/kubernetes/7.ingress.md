# Detailed Guide on Kubernetes Ingress: History and Usage

Kubernetes Ingress has become an essential component of cloud-native application architecture, facilitating external access to services within a Kubernetes cluster. This guide delves into the history of Ingress, its necessity, the role of Ingress Controllers, and how users can leverage Ingress in their Kubernetes environments.

## Evolution of Ingress in Kubernetes

Until 2015, Kubernetes primarily relied on Services, specifically the `LoadBalancer` type, to expose applications to the outside world. However, this approach had limitations, including cost implications due to the requirement for a public IP per service and limited support for advanced routing capabilities.

Recognizing these challenges, the Kubernetes community introduced the Ingress API in 2015. Ingress was designed to offer more sophisticated traffic routing options, such as path-based routing, and to reduce the need for multiple public IPs.

## The Introduction of Ingress Controllers

To bridge the gap between the abstract Ingress API and real-world load balancing solutions, the concept of Ingress Controllers was introduced. Ingress Controllers are responsible for fulfilling the rules set in Ingress resources by acting on the traffic that passes through them.

### How Ingress Controllers Work

- **Ingress Resource**: Users define routing rules using the `kind: Ingress` resource. These rules include path-based routing to different backend services.
- **Ingress Controller Deployment**: Users deploy an Ingress Controller in their cluster. This controller reads the Ingress Resource and configures the load balancer accordingly.

### Ingress Controllers by Load Balancer Providers

Various load balancer providers, including Nginx, HAProxy, and F5, have developed their own Ingress Controllers. These controllers interpret the Ingress Resource and apply the defined rules using their proprietary load balancing technologies.

## Practical Implementation of Ingress

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement Ingress in a Kubernetes cluster:

### Step 1: Deploy an Ingress Controller

First, choose and deploy an Ingress Controller that suits your needs. For example, to deploy the Nginx Ingress Controller:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.0.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml

```

## Step 2: Define an Ingress Resource
Create an Ingress Resource to define how external traffic should be routed to your services. Here's an example Ingress definition that routes traffic based on the path:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: www.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /app1
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: app1-service
            port:
              number: 80
      - path: /app2
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: app2-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

## Step 3: Apply the Ingress Resource
```bash
kubectl apply -f example-ingress.yaml

```


The Ingress Controller will read this resource and configure the load balancer to route external traffic to the appropriate services based on the defined rules.
## Conclusion

The evolution of Ingress in Kubernetes from a simple concept to a robust solution for external traffic management highlights the community's response to the growing needs of cloud-native applications. By leveraging Ingress and Ingress Controllers, users can efficiently manage external access to their services with advanced routing capabilities, security features, and reduced infrastructure costs.

This guide provides a foundational understanding of Kubernetes Ingress, its historical context, and practical usage examples, serving as a valuable resource for architects, developers, and administrators working in Kubernetes environments.
