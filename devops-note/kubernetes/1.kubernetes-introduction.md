# Introduction to Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

## Why Kubernetes?

In today's software development, applications are often broken down into microservices. This approach necessitates running multiple containers across multiple servers. Kubernetes provides the infrastructure to build a container-centric development environment.

### Key Features

- **Automated Scheduling**: Kubernetes automatically schedules containers based on resource usage and constraints, without sacrificing availability.
- **Self-Healing Capabilities**: It restarts failed containers, replaces and reschedules containers when nodes die, kills containers that don't respond to user-defined health checks, and doesn't advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve.
- **Automated Rollouts & Rollbacks**: You can describe the desired state for your deployed containers using Kubernetes, and it can change the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. For example, you can automate Kubernetes to create new containers for your deployment, remove existing containers, and adopt all their resources to the new container.
- **Horizontal Scaling & Load Balancing**: Kubernetes allows you to scale your application up and down with a simple command, with a UI, or automatically based on CPU usage.

## Core Concepts

- **Pods**: The smallest deployable units that can be created and managed in Kubernetes. A Pod typically represents one running process in your cluster.
- **Services**: An abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.
- **Deployments**: Manage the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods and provide declarative updates to Pods along with a lot of other useful features.
- **Namespaces**: Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces, which allow you to partition resources into logically named groups.

## Kubernetes Architecture

Kubernetes follows a client-server architecture. The components that make up Kubernetes can be divided into those that manage an individual node and those that are part of the control plane.

### Control Plane

The control plane's components make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling), as well as detecting and responding to cluster events (for example, starting up a new pod when a deployment's replicas field is unsatisfied).

### Nodes

A node is a worker machine in Kubernetes and may be a VM or a physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each node has the services necessary to run Pods and is managed by the control plane.

## Getting Started

To get started with Kubernetes, you can set up a local development environment with [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/). Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your personal computer (including Windows, macOS, and Linux PCs) so that you can try out Kubernetes, or develop with it day-to-day.

## Conclusion

Kubernetes simplifies container management and orchestrates computing, networking, and storage infrastructure on behalf of user workloads. It has become the cornerstone of container-based application deployment in today's cloud-native world.
